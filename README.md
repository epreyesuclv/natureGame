# NatureGame
 
This is my final project that I made for University in 2nd year, in colaboration with laritzam.p.g@gmail.com . This is 
a nature simulator with some few animals

# How works?

 The animals have a random movement while it  haven't  any "food" in neighbor cells(nine cells around the location)
 there are the follow animals in the enviorment :

 Bunny

 Snake

 Owl

 Vulture

 
 Other elements in the enviormet:

 Plant

 Rock 

 Bones
 

 An animal consider a "food" another element in the enviorment following the next rules:

 Bunny eats plant

 snake eats bunny

 owl eats bunny and snake

 vulture eats bones (bones is refer to dead animal)


 The follows rules are in the enviorment to:

-animals dies when pass "x" turn without feed and it transform in bones, every animal as a different "x"

-plant spwan every "y" turn (I thing is 7 turns)

-rock is en element in the enviorment that only owl and vulture can occupy it position


there are some other feature that I add to the project, like simulator speed and 
graphic statistics, so enjoy it
